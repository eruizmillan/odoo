Install modules in Odoo
1.- We will access by SSH or SFTP and we will look for the next route:
 
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/odoo/addons/

2.- Within this directory, copy the folder with the files of the modules (previously downloaded from the portal https://apps.odoo.com or by the developer who created the module). In both cases, it will always be a ZIP that we will have to unzip.

3.- After uploading the files, we will check that the user and group permissions are correct.

4.- Inside Odoo, go to the applications area and click on: "Module Update Result".



5.- After updating the list, the new module will appear in the list. In this case, the module is called: "Sale manager own clients".



6.- Access the module and mark: "Install".



7.- From here, the configuration varies depending on the operation of the installed module.
